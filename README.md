# Random Conversation Starter

This Java program generates random conversation starters, including motivational quotes, Bible verses, and fun facts. It utilizes a simple graphical user interface (GUI) through `JOptionPane` to display the conversation starters to the user.

## Features

- **Motivational Quotes:** Displays a random motivational quote to inspire and uplift.
- **Bible Verses:** Shows a random Bible verse with encouraging words.
- **Fun Facts:** Provides random fun facts or little-known trivia.

## How It Works

1. Upon running the program, a dialog box will appear, giving the user the option to choose between three categories:
    - Motivational quotes
    - Bible verses
    - Fun facts
2. The program will then display a random item from the chosen category.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher.
- Any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans) or command-line environment to compile and run the code.

## Running the Program

1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `randomNumbers.java` file in your Java IDE or text editor.
3. Compile and run the program.

### Example of the Program Running:

Upon selecting an option, the user will see a dialog with a random motivational quote, Bible verse, or fun fact, depending on their selection. For example:

- **Motivational Quote:** "Believe you can and you're halfway there."
- **Bible Verse:** "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son. (John 3:16)"
- **Fun Fact:** "Humans share 50% DNA with bananas."
